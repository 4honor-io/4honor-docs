# Welcome to 4Honor.io

:::info
Currently 4Honor is in `alpha` version. You can use 100% of the app for free.
we don't plan to activate pricing before the beta version.
:::

4Honor is gamification system that push your team to the next level.
In average developer leaves companies every 2 years. Most of the time itâ€™s
because of a burn-outs. 4Honor uses a gamification system to collect faily data
and expose realtime dashboard helping you to determine your developer's
mental health.

The gamification approch of 4Honor will allow your team to be transparent
effortlessly. We truly believe a transparent team is possible only if both
side are winners: **the win-win system**.

This system is really simple:

- increase the acknowledgement (tanks to experience, gold and honor).
- obtains developers mental metrics in return.

:::danger
4honor **does not want** to be an **intrusive** tracking app.

Make 4Honor mandatory or use it in an intrusive way could result in a
**permanent ban**.

## Adventures

Everything happen under an adventure. You can define an adventure with the
granularity that fit your needs. You could have

- one adventure for your whole organization,
- one adventure per team,
- one adventure per project,

The main idea is to group metrics that makes sense for you and your teammates.

Eveytime something happen on your daily tools 4honor will be notify and rewards
developers for their action. For example, everytime someone merge a pull request
he will receive some experience points and gold.

### Experience

More experience you gain, higher your level will be. The fun part is your level
is proportional to your knowledge of project(s) that represents the adventure.

In that way you can easily find who did the more on the project.

### Gold

The gold is used to buy extra rewards that your company could add to your
adventure shop. The company can define what it wants as an item to buy. We could
easily imagine having a book about the next version of your favorite language.

The more your do, the more you receive.

### Honor

Finaly, the last rewards type is the honor. Everytime someone help you or did a
great "move", you can honor. The honor system is anonymous, the main concern is
to give to your folks the gratitude they deserve without expecting a return.

This is certainly one the most important feature of 4honor. Too often
developers doesn't feel appreciated at their fair value. Thanks to a simple
button, this feeling will be forgotten.

## Achievements

Achievements is the on progress feature! The main idea is to measure the
knowledge of your teammates. You could see as achievements in video games
such as World of Warcraft.

---

Let's suppose we have an achievement `mastery SQL query` (what a common achievements).
You're reading a pull request from one of your teammates and then you see he
write an amazing fast SQL query.

You decide to give him the achievement `mastery SQL query` because you think you know
SQL well.

---

This feature is really helpfull to motivate folks to learn new stuff
(to earn new achievement) but also to give your some data for his periodical
job review.

## Integrations

On every integrations you could add as many integrations as you want. An integrations
could be see as a source of data. For example, we can add `Github` to give rewards
on pull request merged or approve event.

Because we're in `alpha` we only support `Github`.
We plan to add more integrations prioritized by community needs.
