# Welcome to 4Honor.io

:::info
Currently, 4Honor is in `alpha`. You can use 100% of the app for free.
We don't plan to activate pricing before the beta version.
:::

4Honor is a gamification system that pushes your team to the next level.
An average developer leaves companies every 2 years. Most of the time itâ€™s
because of burn-outs. 4Honor uses a gamification system to collect fairly data
and exposes a real-time dashboard helping you to determine your developer's
mental health.

The gamification approach of 4Honor allows your team to be transparent
effortlessly. We truly believe a transparent team is possible only if both
sides are winners: **the win-win system**.

This system is really simple:

- Increase the acknowledgment (thanks to experience, gold and honor).
- Obtain developers mental metrics in return.

:::danger
4Honor **does not want** to be an **intrusive** tracking app.

Making 4Honor mandatory or using it in an intrusive way could result in a
**permanent ban**.

## Adventures

Everything happens under an adventure. You define an adventure with the
granularity that fits your needs.

You could have:

- One adventure for your whole organization.
- One adventure per team.
- One adventure per project.

The main idea is to group metrics that makes sense for you and your teammates.

Everytime something happens on your daily tools, 4Honor will be notified and reward
developers for their action. For example, everytime someone merges a pull request,
he will receive some experience points and gold.

### Experience

The more experience you gain, the higher your level will be. The fun part is your level
is proportional to your knowledge of project(s) that represent the adventure.

In that way you can easily find who did the most on the project.

### Gold

Gold is used to buy extra rewards that your company could add to your
adventure shop. The company can define what it wants as an items in the shop.
We could easily imagine having a book about the next version of your favorite language.

The more you do, the more you receive.

### Honor

Finally, the last reward type is the honor. Everytime someone helps you or did a
great "move", you can honor. The honor system is anonymous. The main concern is
to give your folks the gratitude they deserve without expecting a return.

This is certainly one the most important features of 4Honor. Too often
developers don't feel appreciated at their fair value. Thanks to a simple
button, that feeling will be forgotten.

## Achievements

Achievements is the in progress feature! The main idea is to measure the
knowledge of your teammates. You could see this similar to an achievements in video games
such as World of Warcraft.

---

Let's suppose we have an achievement `mastery SQL query` (what a common achievement).
You're reading a pull request from one of your teammates and then you see they
write an amazing fast SQL query.

You decide to give them the achievement `mastery SQL query` because you feel they know
SQL well.

---

This feature is really helpful to motivate folks to learn new stuff
(to earn new achievements) but also to give you some data for their periodical
job review.

## Integrations

On every integration, you could add as many integrations as you want. An integration
could be seen as a source of data. For example, we can add `Github` to give rewards
on pull requests merged or approved events.

Because we're in `alpha`, we only support `Github`.
We plan to add more integrations prioritized by community needs.
